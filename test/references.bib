HDPL is one of the most promising applications in the field of cooperative driving. The goal of this application is to improve fuel and road efficiency without impairing safety. The level of efficiency improvement depends on the instantaneous channel quality. Strong multipath components, which arise from other vehicles, traffic signs, and surrounding buildings in such a highly dynamic vehicular environment, significantly influence the instantaneous link quality between communicating vehicles in a platoon. An emerging concept of vehicle sensor-aided predictive communications has shown its potential to improve direct-link communication. In this paper, the applicability of this approach is evaluated in terms of inter-vehicle distance error, which reflects the difficulties that the control algorithm has to cope with in the communications conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed sensor-based approach significantly improves the platoon performance even if affected by multiple dynamic scattering reflections at the same time.},

The proposed concept makes use of vehicular sensors combined with unique properties of surrounding environment to predict future changes in the communication scenario. This combination enables a new range of improvements in the direct-link vehicular communications. Among others, it allows predicting the Doppler frequency shift for some strong channel components in highly dynamic scenarios and estimating the likelihood for the communicating vehicles to remain in the line-of-sight conditions. A predictive Doppler-shift compensation is presented as an illustrative example of one of potential benefits for future vehicular communications. The algorithm is applied to compensate the strong line-of-sight component as well as the line-of-sight with one strong reflection which is received at the same sampling interval. The obtained simulation results show that the proposed sensor-based Doppler-shift prediction and compensation approach outperforms a benchmark least-squares channel estimation with linear interpolation algorithm in various road scenarios (urban, rural, and highway) and relative driving directions (same and oncoming) of communicating vehicles.},

Packet switched networks-on-chip (NoC) have been proposed to support the trend for systems-on-chip integration. In this paper, an advanced NoC architecture, called Xpipes, targeting high performance and reliable communication for on-chip multi-processors is introduced. It consists of a library of soft macros (switches, network interfaces and links) that are design-time composable and tunable so that domain-specific heterogeneous architectures can be instantiated and synthesized. Links can be pipelined with a flexible number of stages to decouple link throughput from its length and to get arbitrary topologies. Moreover, a tool called XpipesCompiler, which automatically instantiates a customized NoC from the library of soft network components, is used in this paper to test the Xpipes-based synthesis flow for domain-specific communication architectures.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study a cooperative vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interference-limited communication system with decode-and-forward relaying operating over double-Nakagami (DN) fading channels. This distribution has been proposed as a fading model for scenarios where both the transmitter and the receiver are in motion, as is the case in V2V communications. For the purposes of our analysis, we introduce the bivariate DN distribution and derive statistical metrics for this distribution, such as the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, and the moments. The new expressions have been employed to model the outdated channel state information (CSI) that is due to the fast time-varying nature of the wireless medium and the delay naturally existing between relay selection and data transmission instances. The analysis considers two relay selection schemes, according to the relay-destination channel quality, namely the well-known best relay selection (BRS) and a new one termed as threshold-based relay selection, which offers lower complexity than BRS. Using our analytical framework, exact and asymptotic performance results are obtained for the outage and the average symbol error probabilities, while the diversity order has been also evaluated. The numerical and simulation results corroborate our theoretical ones and quantify the impact of the outdated CSI, level of interference, and varying distances between the relay nodes and the final destination on the system's performance.},

Current technologies like IEEE 802.11p and recent solutions like fixed period beaconing or moderately reactive adaptive approaches do not cope with these requirements and lead to scalability problems in high density scenarios. With the aim of avoiding channel congestion in those scenarios we make use of trajectory prediction to reduce the number of transmissions required for a full awareness of the vehicle's position and speed. To do so, only a data prediction model of the vehicle's trajectory is sent over the channel. This allows to meet the latency requirements of safety applications while not relying exclusively on MAC congestion control protocols nor modifying the current standard MAC layer. In order to evaluate the proposed approach, we simulate a V2I network in a road intersection under high density traffic taking into account the packet delivery ratio and the predicted position error metrics. Finally, the simulation results show a better position awareness with a reduced channel load compared to the fixed periodic beaconing approach under high density traffic.},

  abstract = {One of the most challenge applications in VANET is a safety application. The important characteristic of this application is stringent time constraints. To satisfy these constraints, seamless handoffs must be provided. The mechanism making successful seamless handoffs is a network selection technique. Several techniques such as AHP, SAW, GRA and TOPSIS were proposed to select a network satisfying application QoS and user preferences. However, these techniques have not been empirically validated and feasibly studied on embedded boxes in vehicles. Since embedded boxes have limitations on memory usages, CPU speed and etc, then the selection techniques should consume small memory usages and low computation time. In this work, the decision tree for AHP is considered since it utilizes low computation time. Moreover, the empirical comparison and feasible study between AHP, SAW, GRA, TOPSIS and the decision tree for AHP are carried out. The results show that the computation delay of decision tree for AHP is much lower than the one of pre-existing techniques. However, the proposed technique uses little higher memory space than the others.},

Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs) are self-organizing networks that can significantly improve traffic safety and travel comfort, without requiring fixed infrastructure or centralized administration. However, data dissemination in VANET environment is a challenging task, mainly due to rapid changes in network topology and frequent fragmentation. In this paper, we survey existing data dissemination techniques and their performance modeling approaches in VANETs, along with optimization strategies under two basic models: the push model, and the pull model. In addition, we present major research challenges.},

To achieve better performance, the channel state information (CSI) is estimated by the pilot. However, the estimated CSI cannot be used in downlinks when the mobile speed is very high, since it becomes outdated due to the rapid channel variation. In a massive MIMO system, the issue of outdated CSI is serious when using traditional techniques. Therefore, in order to obtain accurate CSI, the prediction of future CSI is required. In this paper, a low complexity online extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed for the online prediction of the fast fading channel. First, we introduce the structure of the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) and combine the training process of the OS-ELM with a forgetting mechanism (FM) to predict fast changing channels. Second, we use the truncated polynomial expansion (TPE) to reduce the computational complexity of the OS-ELM with the FM (FOS-ELM). In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithm is verified through simulation results, and we apply channel prediction in the precoding process. It is shown that the communication quality is improved by our channel prediction algorithm.},

V2V channels generally may have contributions from the line-of-sight path, reflections from large stationary and moving objects such as bridges and other vehicles, and a diffuse base from large numbers of small stationary objects in the environment. We propose a new geometrical model for the diffuse component based on scattering objects distributed along the roadside, and use this model to predict the Doppler spectrum and angle-of-arrival distribution associated with this component for various V2V scenarios. In contrast with previous roadside scattering models that sum the contributions from large numbers of randomly-generated scattering objects, our model assumes a uniform linear distribution along the roadside. This permits a computationally efficient, closed-form model. Comparisons with on-road measurement data as well as the double ring model demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Three different predictors based on the statistical sinusoidal model are proposed. These methods outperform the standard linear predictor (LP) in Monte Carlo simulations, but underperform with real measurement data, probably due to nonstationary model parameters. To mitigate these modeling errors, a joint moving average and sinusoidal (JMAS) prediction model and the associated joint least-squares (LS) predictor are proposed. It combines the sinusoidal model with an LP to handle unmodeled dynamics in the signal. The joint LS predictor outperforms all the other sinusoidal LMMSE predictors in suburban environments, but still performs slightly worse than the standard LP in urban environments.},

In this paper, we propose Single-cycle Multi-hop Asynchronous Repeated Traversal (SMART) NoC, a NoC that reconfigures and tailors a generic mesh topology for SoC applications at runtime. The heart of our SMART NoC is a novel low-swing clockless repeated link circuit embedded within the router crossbars, that allows packets to potentially bypass all the way from source to destination core within a single clock cycle, without being latched at any intermediate router. Our clockless repeater link has been proven in silicon in 45nm SOI. Results show that at 2GHz, we can traverse 8mm within a single cycle, i.e. 8 hops with 1mm cores. We implement the SMART NoC to layout and show that SMART NoC gives 60\% latency savings, and 2.2X power savings compared to a baseline mesh NoC.},

@book{DesigningGloballyasynchronousLocallysynchronous,
  title = {Designing Globally-Asynchronous Locally-Synchronous on-Chip Communication Networks},
  abstract = {This thesis addresses two aspects of designing on-chip communication networks. One is about applying Globally-Asynchronous Locally-Synchronous (GALS) communication scheme into Network-on-Chip (NoC). Another is of designing and realizing different types of on-chip communication structures in the frame of GALS scheme. The work of applying GALS scheme into on-chip networks presented in this thesis includes the strategy of realizing GALS scheme in a NoC, synchronization method in a GALS NoC, and asynchronous circuit design. GALS scheme is applied in the NoC designs presented in this thesis by applying synchronous style in the communications between network nodes and their attached function hosts while applying asynchronous style in the communications among network nodes. The asynchronous circuits developed for realizing the GALS on-chip networks include an asynchronous First-In First-Out (FIFO) design, control pipeline structures, C-element structure, and an arbiter design. Three different types of on-chip networks are designed and presented in this thesis, which include a direct network, a Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) network, and a crossbar network. The direct on-chip network presented in this thesis is a bidirectional ring network which gives an example of realizing GALS scheme in Proteo NoC architecture. The ring network realization consists of six nodes and requires an area of 177K equivalent gates when it is realized with a 0.18{$\mu$}m standard-cell library of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Although the ring network has a scalable network structure, its data transfer latency can vary largely depending on the data destination and routing process. This drawback increases the difficulty for the ring network to provide constant quality of communication service. Therefore, a network structure which applies CDMA technique is developed and presented in this thesis in order to provide non-blocking data transfers among network nodes so that data transfer latencies have small variances. The CDMA NoC achieves this feature by applying orthogonal codes to build non-blocking data transfer channels among network nodes. The six-node realization of CDMA NoC presented in this thesis has an area of 272K equivalent gates when it is realized with a 0.18{$\mu$}m standard-cell library and the data path width is 32 bits. The compensation of the larger area cost is that the asynchronous data transfer latency in the six-node CDMA NoC is equivalent to the best-case latency in the ring network. When the data path width is 32 bits, the realized CDMA network can transfer a 96-bit payload packet between network nodes within 49ns through a four-phase handshake protocol if there is no congestion of destination, which is equivalent to 11.76Gbits/s throughput of the network. Crossbar is a well-known structure which can also supply the feature of non-blocking data transfers. Therefore, a six-node crossbar network is developed in this work as a reference to evaluate the CDMA network. In comparison with the six-node crossbar network, the CDMA network realization has 39.4\% larger logic gate area cost when the data path width is 8 bits, whereas, the number of data wires in the CDMA network is 80.1\% less than the number in the crossbar network if there are 31 network nodes. Besides ASIC realizations, a four-node GALS bidirectional ring network is realized on an Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device as an example of prototyping a synchronousasynchronous mixed NoC design on a Look-Up-Table (LUT) based FPGA device. The realization consumes 41.7K LUTs on an Altera StratixII FPGA device.},

  abstract = {Adaptive transmission methods can potentially aid the achievement of high data rates required for mobile radio multimedia services. To realize this potential, the transmitter needs accurate channel state information (CSI) for the upcoming transmission frame. In most mobile radio systems, the CSI is estimated at the receiver and fed back to the transmitter. However, unless the mobile speed is very low, the estimated CSI cannot be used directly to select the parameters of adaptive transmission systems, since it quickly becomes outdated due to the rapid channel variation caused by multipath fading. To enable adaptive transmission for mobile radio systems, prediction of future fading channel samples is required. Several fundamental issues arise in the design and testing of fading prediction algorithms for adaptive transmission systems. These include complexity, robustness, choice of an appropriate channel model for algorithm validation, channel estimation and noise reduction required for reliable prediction, and design and analysis of adaptive transmission methods aided by fading prediction algorithms. We use these criteria in the review of recent advances in the area of fading channel prediction. We also demonstrate that reliable fading prediction makes adaptive transmission feasible in diverse wireless communication systems.},

However, current LTE and LTE-Advanced mobile networks do not supply the UE with an explicit indicator about the currently achievable data rate. For this reason, the mobile device will only see what it obtains from the network once it actively sends data. A passive estimation in advance is therefore not doable without further effort. Although the device can identify its current radio conditions based on the received signal strength and quality, it has no information about the cell's traffic load caused by other users. To close this gap we present an Enhanced Client-based Control-Channel Analysis for Connectivity Estimation (E-C3ACE), which uncovers the cell load broken down by each single user. Based on this information and in conjunction with existing indicators like Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ), a neural network is trained to perform a data rate prediction for the current LTE link. Compared to an earlier work, our approach reduces the average prediction error below one third. Applied in public networks, the predicted data rate differs by less than 1.5 Mbit/s in 93\% of cases.},

  abstract = {AutoNet2030 - Co-operative Systems in Support of Networked Automated Driving by 2030 - is a European project connecting two domains of intensive research: cooperative systems for Intelligent Transportation Systems and Automated Driving. Given the latest developments in the standardization of vehicular communications, vehicles will soon be wirelessly connected, enabling cooperation among them and with the infrastructure. At the same time, some vehicles will offer very advanced driving assistance systems, ranging from Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (C-ACC) to full automation. The research issues addressed in AutoNet2030 are as follows: how can all these vehicles with different capabilities most efficiently cooperate to increase safety and fluidity of the traffic system? What kind of information should be exchanged? Which organization (e.g. centralized or distributed) is the best? The purpose of this paper is to introduce the vision and concepts underlying the AutoNet2030 project and the direction of this ongoing research work.},

  abstract = {Moore's law is the observation that over the years, the transistor density will increase, allowing billions of transistors to be integrated on a single chip. Over the last two decades, Moore's law has enabled the implementation of complex systems on a single chip(SoCs). The challenge of the System-on-Chip(SoC) era was the demand of an efficient communication mechanism between the growing number of processing cores on the chip. The outcome established an new interconnection scheme (among others, like crossbars, rings, buses) based on the telecommunication networks and the Network- on-Chip(NoC) appeared on the scene.The NoC has been developed not only to support systems embedded into a single processor, but also to support a set of processors embedded on a single chip.Therefore, the Multi-Processors System on Chip(MPSoC) has arisen, which incorporate processing elements, memories and I/O with a fixed interconnection infrastructure in a complete integrated system. In such systems, the NoC constitutes the backbone of the communication architecture that targets future SoC composed by hundred of processing elements. Besides that, together with the deep sub-micron technology progress, some drawbacks have arisen. The communication efficiency and the reliability of the systems rely on the proper functionality of NoC for onchip data communication. A NoC must deal with the susceptibility of transistors to failure that indicates the demand for a fault tolerant communication infrastructure. A mechanism that can deal with the existence of different classes of faults(transient, intermittent and permanent [11]) which can occur in the communication network.In this thesis, different algorithms are investigated that implement fault tolerant techniques for permanent faults in the NoC. The outcome would be to deliver a faulttolerant mechanism for the NoC System Generator Tool [29] which is a research in Network-on-Chip carried out at the Royal Institute of Technology. It will be explicitly described the fault tolerant algorithm that is implemented in the switch in order to achieve packet rerouting around the faulty communication links.},

  abstract = {Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are a new addition to the world of data center acceleration. While the underlying technology has been around for decades, their application in data centers slowly starts gaining traction. However, there are myriad problems that hinder the widespread application of FPGAs in the data center. The closed source tool chains result in vendor lock-in and unstable tool flows. The languages used to program FPGAs require different design processes which are not easily learned by software developers. Compared to commodity solutions using CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs are more expensive and more time consuming to develop for. All of this and more make FPGAs a tough sell to people in need of task acceleration.

Nonetheless, FPGAs also offer an opportunity to develop faster accelerators with a smaller energy envelop for rapidly changing applications. This work presents a solution to FPGA abstraction using the TaPaSCo framework. TaPaSCo simplifies moving between different FPGA architectures and automates scaling of accelerators across a multitude of devices. In addition, the framework provides a homogenized way of interacting with the accelerators.

This thesis presents applications where FPGAs offer many benefits in the data center. Applications such as Semi-Global Block Matching which are difficult to compute on CPUs and GPUs due to the specific data transfer patterns, can be implemented highly efficiently an FPGAs. The presented work achieves over 35x of speedup on FPGAs compared to implementations of GPUs.

FPGAs can also be used to improve network efficiency in the data center by replacing central network components with smart switches. The work presented here achieves up to 7x speedup over a classical distributed software implementation in a hash join scenario.

Furthermore, FPGA can be used to bring new storage technologies into the data center by providing highly efficient consensus services right inside the network. The presented work shows that fetching pages remotely using a FPGA accelerated consensus system can be done as fast as 10us over the network which is only 55\% of a conventional solution. These results make non-volatile network storage solutions as replacement for main memory viable.

Lastly, this thesis presents a way of simulating parts of a brain with a very high level accuracy using FPGA. The spiking neural networks employed in the accelerator can benefit the research of brain functionality. The accelerator is capable of handling tens of thousands of neurons with a strict real time requirement of 50us per simulation step.},

  abstract = {Access to reliable estimates of the wireless channel, such as the channel state information (CSI) and the received signal strength would open opportunities for timely adaptation of transmission parameters and consequently increased throughput and transmission efficiency in vehicular communications. To design the adaptive transmission schemes, it is important to understand the realistic channel properties, especially in vehicular environments where the mobility of communication devices causes rapid channel variation. However, getting CSI estimates is challenging due to the lack of support for obtaining CSI from the chipset. In this paper, we present our efforts towards enabling reliable, up-to-date channel estimates in vehicular communications. We begin by designing and conducting a measurement campaign where we collect IQ (in-phase and quadrature) samples of the IEEE 802.11p transmission and implement CSI extraction algorithms to obtain and analyze wireless channel estimates from various real-world environments. We then propose a deep learning-based channel prediction for predicting future CSI and received signal levels. The trace-based evaluation demonstrates that our prediction approach improves the future power level estimate by 15\% to 25\% in terms of the root-mean-square-error compared to the latest known channel properties, thus, providing a sound basis for future efforts in anticipatory vehicular communication transmission adaptation.},

  abstract = {A promising application of cooperative driving is the exchange of safety-relevant time-critical information. With the support of communications, vehicles can improve safety by communicating the output of their advanced driver-assistance systems. The level of improvement is however very dependent on the instantaneous channel quality at the time of the information exchange. The configuration of the communication partners, but also the other vehicles, traffic signs and buildings that compose the surrounding dynamic environment, create strong time-varying multipath components. Existing measurement campaigns show that such components can bring positive and negative impacts on the communication link depending on the instantaneous properties of the surrounding environment. An emerging concept of vehicle sensor-aided communications has shown its potential to improve direct-link communication via utilizing information about the surrounding environment provided by vehicle sensors. In this paper we show that the sensor-aided predictive communications can improve the safety in cooperative emergency braking situations. The performance of this approach is evaluated in terms of application related metrics variation compared to various channel conditions: perfect, realistic vehicular channel model, and the blocked channel. Simulation results show that the proposed sensor-based approach significantly improves the emergency braking performance for both the head-on and rear-end collision scenarios.},

This value is our objective in terms of quality of service prediction for a high-density platooning application. This application indeed requires the exchange of information with low latency and high reliability. The prediction of the packet inter-reception time is therefore of high interest for this scenario. We extend our discrete kernel density estimation model to a continuous model based on the parametrization of an exponential distribution. In this model, the rate of the distribution is a function of our predictors, the inter-antenna distance and the spatial distribution of the surrounding communicating vehicles. We approach this function using a multi-layer perceptron regressor for different granularity values of our spatial model. Based on simulation data obtained with a combination of ns-3 and SUMO, we show that our model performs better than our previous model. This performance, combined with the advantages of being continuous and being able to be trained on-line, is promising for a further deployment and test on other scenarios. We present further results on the influence of the interaction between inter-antenna distance and spatial distribution of the communicating vehicles. Finally, we show a successful example of on-line instantaneous prediction of the packet inter-reception time along with the observed values of the predictors and the experienced packet inter-reception time.},

  abstract = {The number of connected cars is growing continuously. Many car manufacturers offer systems, which provide online content to the passengers, mostly infotainment and information data. Although new wireless data communications technologies like LTE will offer much more performance, the increasing number of mobile data users in combination with higher individual data traffic will nullify the higher capacities. Mobile data bandwidth will remain a rare commodity. If next generations driver assistance systems should be supplied with data from central servers in time and according to their individual priorities, it is important to make optimal use of the available resources. Considering the changing channel conditions of the wireless links offers potential for improvements, since the channel quality has a direct influence on the utilization of the data channel. HSPA and LTE use the so called Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) as a measure of the channel conditions. Summarized in a map, server-side applications can use a priori knowledge of the location-dependent channel quality to optimize the data distribution to mobile clients. This paper describes the process of creating CQI maps for HSDPA networks, from the initial collection of raw data to the final validation of the proposed concept.},

  abstract = {The periodic broadcast of a safety message (SM) containing vehicle position and motion data is the salient mechanism for providing drivers pre-crash alerts in Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) networks. However, if SMs are compromised or contain erroneous information, drivers may be unaware of impending danger. Even if vehicles were also equipped with active sensors, awareness may not be achievable in severe non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions where collision avoidance is needed most. In this work, a novel system for providing collision avoidance using the Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) in V2V networks is presented. Experimental observations of RSSI during collision and no-collision outcomes are analyzed to develop the system's prediction methodology, which is then rigorously tested through a simulation environment to assess the detection performance. The proposed system does not use traditional (Received Signal Strength) RSS distance estimation, fingerprinting, or cooperative methods, which depend heavily on a priori knowledge of path loss conditions. Instead, the decentralized system identifies specific trends in RSSI indicative of a collision. In comparison to RSS distance estimation methods, the proposed system is shown to detect over 35\% more collisions in a variety of channel conditions, including NLOS.},

For this purposes, a number of tools have been developed, the realization of which full potential is possible only if there is feedback from the User Equipment (UE) - Channel State Information (CSI). However, in conditions of fading in the radio channel, there is a problem of ensuring the relevance of the indicators included in the CSI for subsequent data transmission in downlink. This problem has the name of the CSI-Ageing or CSI-Outdating. There are a number of methods for compensating the CSI-Ageing. Today, the most effective method to minimize the impact of this effect is prediction. There are many developed algorithms and a lot of research on this topic. However, there are only a few complete reviews these algorithms. This paper has the main purpose of conducting such a review and analysis in order to identify the most promising algorithms for further research.},

In this paper, we design DeepChannel, an encoder-decoder based sequence-to-sequence deep learning model that is capable of predicting future wireless signal strength variations based on past signal strength data. We consider two different versions of DeepChannel; the first and second versions use LSTM and GRU as their basic cell structure, respectively. In contrast to prior work that is primarily focused on designing models for particular network settings, DeepChannel is highly adaptable and can predict future channel conditions for different networks, sampling rates, mobility patterns, and communication standards. We compare the performance (i.e., the root mean squared error, mean absolute error and relative error of future predictions) of DeepChannel with respect to two baselines\textemdash{}i) linear regression, and ii) ARIMA for multiple networks and communication standards. In particular, we consider 4G LTE, WiFi, WiMAX, an industrial network operating in the 5.8 GHz range, and Zigbee networks operating under varying levels of user mobility and observe that DeepChannel provides significantly superior performance. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of the key design decisions including insights into hyper-parameter tuning and the applicability of our model in other networking scenarios.},

It is the feasible solution for pipelined architecture and parallel processing in multiprocessor system on chip. The research article presents the NoC architecture for flexible and scalable design under 3D mesh topological structure. The design is considered for 8 layers as multilayered architecture. In one layer 64 nodes can communicate with each other. The design is developed with the help of VHDL programming in Xilinx ISE 14.2 software and functionally simulated in Modelsim 10.0 student edition software. The performance of the design is analyzed with hardware parameters and timing utilization parameters on Virtex 5 FPGA. The inter and intra communication among the nodes is verified on the same FPGA. The design is verified on Virtex-5 FPGA with 8, 16, 32, 64 and 128 bit data transfer among nodes when the NoC is fully connected and utilized.

  abstract = {The chip industry faces two key challenges today - the impending end of Moore's Law and the rising costs of chip design and verification (millions of dollars today). Heterogeneous IPs - cores and domain-specific accelerators - are a promising answer to the first challenge, enabling performance and energy benefits no longer provided by technology scaling. IP-reuse with plug-and-play designs can help with the second challenge, amortizing NRE costs tremendously. A key requirement in a heterogeneous IP-based plug-and-play SoC environment is an interconnection fabric to connect these IPs together. This fabric needs to be scalable - low latency, low energy and low area - and yet be flexible/parametrizable for use across designs. The key scalability challenge in any Network-on-Chip (NoC) today is that the latency increases proportional to the number of hops. In this work, we present a NoC generator called OpenSMART, which generates low-latency NoCs based on SMART1. SMART is a recently proposed NoC microarchitecture that enables multihop on-chip traversals within a single cycle, removing the dependence of latency on hops. SMART leverages wire delay of the underlying repeated wires, and augments each router with the ability to request and setup bypass paths. OpenSMART takes SMART from a NoC optimization to a design methodology for SoCs, enabling users to generate verified RTL for a class of userspecified network configurations, such as network size, topology, routing algorithm, number of VCs/buffers, router pipeline stages, and so on. OpenSMART also provides the ability to generate any heterogeneous topology with low and high-radix routers and optimized single-stage pipelines, leveraging fast logic delays in technology nodes today. OpenSMART v1.0 comes with both Bluespec System Verilog and Chisel implementations, and this paper also presents a case study of our experiences with both languages. OpenSMART is available for download2 and is going to be a key addition to the emerging open-source hardware movement, providing a glue for interconnecting existing and emerging IPs.},

Given the type of flow control and router parameters, the model returns router latency in technology-independent units and the number of pipeline stages as a function of cycle time. We apply this model to derive realistic pipelines for wormhole and virtual-channel routers and compare their performance. Contrary to the conclusions of previous models, our results show that the latency of a virtual channel router doesn't increase as we scale the number of virtual channels up to 8 per physical channel. Our simulation results also show that a virtual-channel router gains throughput of up to 40 \% over a wormhole router.},

  abstract = {Channel state information (CSI) estimation is one of the most fundamental problems in wireless communication systems. Various methods, so far, have been developed to conduct CSI estimation. However, they usually require high computational complexity, which makes them unsuitable for 5G wireless communications due to employing many new techniques (e.g., massive MIMO, OFDM, and millimeter-Wave (mmWave)). In this paper, we propose an efficient online CSI prediction scheme, called OCEAN, for predicting CSI from historical data in 5G wireless communication systems. Specifically, we first identify several important features affecting the CSI of a radio link and a data sample consists of the information of the features and the CSI. We then design a learning framework that is an integration of a CNN (convolutional neural network) and a long short term with memory (LSTM) network. We also further develop an offline-online two-step training mechanism, enabling the prediction results to be more stable when applying it to practical 5G wireless communication systems. To validate OCEAN's efficacy, we consider four typical case studies, and conduct extensive experiments in the four scenarios, i.e., two outdoor and two indoor scenarios. The experiment results show that OCEAN not only obtains the predicted CSI values very quickly but also achieves highly accurate CSI prediction with up to 2.650-3.457 percent average difference ratio (ADR) between the predicted and measured CSI.},

  abstract = {Proportional Fair (PF) scheduling algorithms are the de facto standard in cellular networks. They exploit the users' channel state diversity (induced by fast-fading) and are optimal for stationary channel state distributions and an infinite time-horizon. However, mobile users experience a nonstationary channel, due to slow-fading (on the order of seconds), and are associated with base stations for short periods. Hence, we develop the Predictive Finite-horizon PF Scheduling ((PF)2S) Framework that exploits mobility. We present extensive channel measurement results from a 3G network and characterize mobility-induced channel state trends. We show that a user's channel state is highly reproducible and leverage that to develop a data rate prediction mechanism. We then present a few channel allocation estimation algorithms that exploit the prediction mechanism. Our trace-based simulations consider instances of the (PF)2S Framework composed of combinations of prediction and channel allocation estimation algorithms. They indicate that the framework can increase the throughput by 15\%-55\% compared to traditional PF schedulers, while improving fairness.},

By communicating with other vehicles and with Road Side Units (RSUs) VANET provides many lifesaving and commercial services. There are no fix infrastructures in VANET. Both Vehicle-To-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) take place with the help of On Board Unit (OBU) which is residing on the vehicle. Scheduling is a very important issue in VANET as messages are to be delivered to the recipient vehicle properly and accurately. It is important to send emergency, lifesaving and messages with critical information before general entertainment and commercial messages. It is also critical that any message which is sent to the vehicle is received by it in the time period for which the vehicle will be in range of the RSU.The objective of our work is to enhance the delivery of a message from RSU to vehicle. To achieve this we will develop a priority based scheduling protocol which will send the message from the RSU to the vehicle in the required time bound by broadcasting periodic messages which results into reduction in network traffic and without affecting the service ratio and without compromising reliability.},

In this paper, focusing on short-range communications, we analyze the technical and economic motivations that are driving the development of new road users\&rsquo; connectivity, discussing the international intentions to mandate on board devices for V2X communication.

As mentioned in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), LTE-based Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is an enabler for V2X services to meet these requirements. Therefore, radio resource management (RRM) is important to efficiently allocate resources to V2X communications. In this paper, we present the V2X communications, their requirements and services, the V2X-based LTE-D2D communication modes, and the existing resource allocation algorithms for V2X communications.

Such services require dependable wireless vehicle-to-infrastructure and vehicle-to-vehicle communications providing robust connectivity at moderate data rates. The development of such dependable vehicular communication systems and standards requires accurate models of the propagation channel in all relevant environments and scenarios. Key characteristics of vehicular channels are shadowing by other vehicles, high Doppler shifts, and inherent nonstationarity. All have major impact on the data packet transmission reliability and latency. This paper provides an overview of the existing vehicular channel measurements in a variety of important environments, and the observed channel characteristics (such as delay spreads and Doppler spreads) therein. We briefly discuss the available vehicular channel models and their respective merits and deficiencies. Finally, we discuss the implications for wireless system design with a strong focus on IEEE 802.11p. On the road towards a dependable vehicular network, room for improvements in coverage, reliability, scalability, and delay are highlighted, calling for evolutionary improvements in the IEEE 802.11p standard. Multiple antennas at the onboard units and roadside units are recommended to exploit spatial diversity for increased diversity and reliability. Evolutionary improvements in the physical (PHY) and medium access control (MAC) layers are required to yield dependable systems. Extensive references are provided.},

Bufferless flow control addresses this issue by removing router buffers, and handles contention by dropping or deflecting flits. This work compares virtual-channel (buffered) and deflection (packet-switched bufferless) flow control. Our evaluation includes optimizations for both schemes: buffered networks use custom SRAM-based buffers and empty buffer bypassing for energy efficiency, while bufferless networks feature a novel routing scheme that reduces average latency by 5\%. Results show that unless process constraints lead to excessively costly buffers, the performance, cost and increased complexity of deflection flow control outweigh its potential gains: bufferless designs are only marginally (up to 1.5\%) more energy efficient at very light loads, and buffered networks provide lower latency and higher throughput per unit power under most conditions.},

Then, it describes an infrastructure called Hermes, targeted to implement packet-switching mesh and related interconnection architectures and topologies. The basic element of Hermes is a switch with five bi-directional ports, connecting to four other switches and to a local IP core. The switch employs an XY routing algorithm, and uses input queuing. The main design objective was to develop a small size switch, enabling its immediate practical use. The paper also presents the design validation of the Hermes switch and of a network on chip based on it. A Hermes NoC case study has been successfully prototyped in hardware as described in the paper, demonstrating the functionality of the approach. Quantitative data for the Hermes infrastructure is advanced.},

  abstract = {An FPGA is a peculiar hardware realization substrate in terms of the relative speed and cost of logic vs. wires vs. memory. In this paper, we present a Network-on-Chip (NoC) design study from the mindset of NoC as a synthesizable infrastructural element to support emerging System-on-Chip (SoC) applications on FPGAs. To support our study, we developed CONNECT, an NoC generator that can produce synthesizable RTL designs of FPGA-tuned multi-node NoCs of arbitrary topology. The CONNECT NoC architecture embodies a set of FPGA-motivated design principles that uniquely influence key NoC design decisions, such as topology, link width, router pipeline depth, network buffer sizing, and flow control. We evaluate CONNECT against a high-quality publicly available synthesizable RTL-level NoC design intended for ASICs. Our evaluation shows a significant gain in specializing NoC design decisions to FPGAs' unique mapping and operating characteristics. For example, in the case of a 4x4 mesh configuration evaluated using a set of synthetic traffic patterns, we obtain comparable or better performance than the state-of-the-art NoC while reducing logic resource cost by 58\%, or alternatively, achieve 3-4x better performance for approximately the same logic resource usage. Finally, to demonstrate CONNECT's flexibility and extensive design space coverage, we also report synthesis and network performance results for several router configurations and for entire CONNECT networks.},

Traditional channel quality prediction problems encompass predicting future conditions based on past measurements of the same channel. In this paper we study the channel quality prediction problem across different wireless channels. To this extent, we consider a reference scenario including multiple 4G cells, each of which operates on multiple concurrent frequency carriers. We propose a framework based on transfer learning to predict the channel quality of a given frequency carrier when no or minimal information is available on the very same frequency carrier for model training. For the transfer learning task we use convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks. We compare their performance against statistical methods on a dataset collected from a commercial 4G mobile radio network. The performance evaluation carried out on the reference dataset demonstrates the validity of the proposed transfer learning approach, achieving a root mean squared error of 0.3 on average.},

  abstract = {In a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), the performance of the communication protocol is influenced heavily by the vehicular density dynamics. However, most of the previous works on VANET performance modeling paid little attention to vehicle distribution, or simply assumed homogeneous car distribution. It is obvious that vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment due to traffic signals and speed limits at different portions of the road, as well as vehicle interactions that are significant on busy streets. In light of the inadequacy, we present in this paper an original methodology to study the broadcasting performance of 802.11p VANETs with practical vehicle distribution in urban environments. Firstly, we adopt the empirically verified stochastic traffic models, which incorporates the effect of urban settings (such as traffic lights and vehicle interactions) on car distribution and generates practical vehicular density profiles. Corresponding 802.11p protocol and performance models are then developed. When coupled with the traffic models, they can predict broadcasting efficiency, delay, as well as throughput performance of 802.11p VANETs based on the knowledge of car density at each location on the road. Extensive simulation is conducted to verify the accuracy of the developed mathematical models with the consideration of vehicle interaction. In general, our results demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology on modeling protocol performance in practical signalized road networks, and shed insights into the design and development of future communication protocols and networking functions for VANETs.},

We explore the performance of existing machine learning algorithms for these problems and propose a simple taxonomy of main problem categories. As an example, we use an extensive real-world drive test data set to show that classical machine learning methods such as Gaussian process regression, exponential smoothing of time series, and random forests can yield excellent prediction results. Applying these methods to the management of wireless mobile networks has the potential to significantly reduce operational costs while simultaneously improving user experience. We also discuss key challenges for future work, especially with the focus on practical deployment of machine learning techniques for performance prediction in mobile wireless networks.},

If it were possible to know the achievable data rate before the connection establishment, content providers could choose the most appropriate representation from the very beginning. We have conducted a measurement campaign involving 60 users connected to a production network in France, to determine whether it is possible to predict the achievable data rate using measurements collected, before establishing the connection to the content provider, on the operator's network and on the mobile node. We show that it is indeed possible to exploit these measurements to predict, with a reasonable accuracy, the achievable data rate.},

  abstract = {Mobile communication has become a part of everyday life and is considered to support reliability and safety in traffic use cases such as conditionally automated driving. Nevertheless, prediction of Quality of Service parameters, particularly throughput, is still a challenging task while on the move. Whereas most approaches in this research field rely on historical data measurements, mapped to the corresponding coordinates in the area of interest, this paper proposes a throughput prediction method that focuses on a location independent approach. In order to compensate the missing positioning information, mainly used for spatial clustering, our model uses low-level mobile network parameters, improved by additional feature engineering to retrieve abstracted location information, e. g., surrounding building size and street type. Thus, the major advantage of our method is the applicability to new regions without the prerequisite of conducting an extensive measurement campaign in advance. Therefore, we embed analysis results for underlying temporal relations in the design of different deep neuronal network types. Finally, model performances are evaluated and compared to traditional models, such as the support vector or random forest regression, which were harnessed in previous investigations.},

To generate the dataset, a tool for monitoring a vehicle-to-server communication in a passive way is presented, too.

A preliminary performance test using Jakes' model is carried out for having a fundamental idea of the performance and the properties of these two models and the different estimation schemes. For more representative results, the most appropriate methods are investigated using data of a huge amount of different radio channels generated by simulations using the statistical model of Dersch. In order to verify the simulation results, the algorithms are further applied to measurement data of a time-variant indoor radio channel. With realistic simulation data or measurements, respectively, the autoregressive model performs best. Depending on the chosen parameter estimation scheme a prediction range of more than one wavelength ahead is feasible. Furthermore, the simulations reveal the common applicability of the proposed prediction schemes in different applications of wireless communications.},

The configurability is inserted as a layer between routers and links, and the architecture can therefore be used in combination with existing NoC routers, making it a general architecture. The topology is configured using energy-efficient topology switches based on physical circuit-switching as found in FPGAs.

The requirements they demand in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) performance vary according to the use case. For instance, Day-1 applications such as Emergency Brake Light warning have less strict requirements than remote driving. In this paper, we seek to answer two questions: Are current LTE networks ready to support Day-1 applications at all times? And, can underperforming situations be reliably predicted based on GPS and network-related information? To address these questions, we first implement a system that collects positioning data and LTE key performance indicators (KPIs) with a higher time resolution than commercial off-the-shelf LTE modems, while simultaneously measuring the end-to-end (E2E) delay of an LTE network. We then use this system to assess the readiness of multiple mobile network operators (MNOs) and a live Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) deployment in an urban scenario. For evaluating whether an adaptable operation is possible in adverse circumstances, e.g., by performing hybrid networking or graceful degradation, we finally use Machine Learning to generate a client-based QoS predictor and forecast the achievable QoS levels.},

In this article, we classify and describe the most relevant vehicular propagation and channel models, with a particular focus on the usability of the models for the evaluation of protocols and applications. We first classify the models based on the propagation mechanisms they employ and their implementation approach. We also classify the models based on the channel properties they implement and pay special attention to the usability of the models, including the complexity of implementation, scalability, and the input requirements (e.g., geographical data input). We also discuss the less-explored aspects in vehicular channel modeling, including modeling specific environments (e.g., tunnels, overpasses, and parking lots) and types of communicating vehicles (e.g., scooters and public transportation vehicles). We conclude by identifying the underresearched aspects of vehicular propagation and channel modeling that require further modeling and measurement studies.},

  abstract = {Low latency is required for connected and intelligent vehicle applications. For instance, safety applications have strict latency requirements. Mobile edge computing (MEC) improves the latency by bringing the computational resources closer to the data source. However, despite the improvements in latency by MEC, the latency will vary based on traffic load and signal conditions. We seek to answer the question: is the current latency environment acceptable for our application? This paper presents our Reliable Latency Decision (ReLaDec) algorithm. ReLaDec uses prior information and the last latency samples to decide whether the latency will be acceptable to our application. The decisions are done with predictable confidence and with ReLaDec the false positive decision rate never exceeds the set maximum value. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithm using 860000 latency samples that include stationary and driving data over multiple USA states.},

  abstract = {The focus of this study is the performance of high-density truck platooning achieved with different wireless technologies for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications. Platooning brings advantages such as lower fuel consumption and better traffic efficiency, which are maximized when the inter-vehicle spacing can be steadily maintained at a feasible minimum. This can be achieved with Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control, an automated cruise controller that relies on the complex interplay among V2V communications, on-board sensing, and actuation. This work provides a clear mapping between the performance of the V2V communications, which is measured in terms of latency and reliability, and of the platoon, which is measured in terms of achievable inter-truck spacing. Two families of radio technologies are compared: IEEE 802.11p and 3GPP Cellular-V2X (C-V2X). The C-V2X technology considered in this work is based on the Release 14 of the LTE standard, which includes two modes for V2V communications: Mode 3 (base-station-scheduled) and Mode 4 (autonomously-scheduled). Results show that C-V2X in both modes allows for shorter inter-truck distances than IEEE 802.11p due to more reliable communications performance under increasing congestion on the wireless channel caused by surrounding vehicles.},

  title = {Designing Globally-Asynchronous Locally-Synchronous on-Chip Communication Networks},
  author = {Wang, X.},

  publisher = {{Tampere University of Technology}},
  abstract = {This thesis addresses two aspects of designing on-chip communication networks. One is about applying Globally-Asynchronous Locally-Synchronous (GALS) communication scheme into Network-on-Chip (NoC). Another is of designing and realizing different types of on-chip communication structures in the frame of GALS scheme. 
The work of applying GALS scheme into on-chip networks presented in this thesis includes the strategy of realizing GALS scheme in a NoC, synchronization method in a GALS NoC, and asynchronous circuit design. GALS scheme is applied in the NoC designs presented in this thesis by applying synchronous style in the communications between network nodes and their attached function hosts while applying asynchronous style in the communications among network nodes. The asynchronous circuits developed for realizing the GALS on-chip networks include an asynchronous First-In First-Out (FIFO) design, control pipeline structures, C-element structure, and an arbiter design. 
Three different types of on-chip networks are designed and presented in this thesis, which include a direct network, a Code-Division Multiple-Access (CDMA) network, and a crossbar network. The direct on-chip network presented in this thesis is a bidirectional ring network which gives an example of realizing GALS scheme in Proteo NoC architecture. The ring network realization consists of six nodes and requires an area of 177K equivalent gates when it is realized with a 0.18{$\mu$}m standard-cell library of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). Although the ring network has a scalable network structure, its data transfer latency can vary largely depending on the data destination and routing process. This drawback increases the difficulty for the ring network to provide constant quality of communication service. 
Therefore, a network structure which applies CDMA technique is developed and presented in this thesis in order to provide non-blocking data transfers among network nodes so that data transfer latencies have small variances. The CDMA NoC achieves this feature by applying orthogonal codes to build non-blocking data transfer channels among network nodes. The six-node realization of CDMA NoC presented in this thesis has an area of 272K equivalent gates when it is realized with a 0.18{$\mu$}m standard-cell library and the data path width is 32 bits. The compensation of the larger area cost is that the asynchronous data transfer latency in the six-node CDMA NoC is equivalent to the best-case latency in the ring network. When the data path width is 32 bits, the realized CDMA network can transfer a 96-bit payload packet between network nodes within 49ns through a four-phase handshake protocol if there is no congestion of destination, which is equivalent to 11.76Gbits/s throughput of the network. 
Crossbar is a well-known structure which can also supply the feature of non-blocking data transfers. Therefore, a six-node crossbar network is developed in this work as a reference to evaluate the CDMA network. In comparison with the six-node crossbar network, the CDMA network realization has 39.4\% larger logic gate area cost when the data path width is 8 bits, whereas, the number of data wires in the CDMA network is 80.1\% less than the number in the crossbar network if there are 31 network nodes. 
Besides ASIC realizations, a four-node GALS bidirectional ring network is realized on an Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) device as an example of prototyping a synchronousasynchronous mixed NoC design on a Look-Up-Table (LUT) based FPGA device. The realization consumes 41.7K LUTs on an Altera StratixII FPGA device.},

  abstract = {Resource allocation has a direct and profound impact on the performance of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. In this paper, we develop a hybrid architecture consisting of centralized decision making and distributed resource sharing (the C-Decision scheme) to maximize the long-term sum rate of all vehicles. To reduce the network signaling overhead, each vehicle uses a deep neural network to compress its observed information that is thereafter fed back to the centralized decision making unit. The centralized decision unit employs a deep Q-network to allocate resources and then sends the decision results to all vehicles. We further adopt a quantization layer for each vehicle that learns to quantize the continuous feedback. In addition, we devise a mechanism to balance the transmission of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. To further facilitate distributed spectrum sharing, we also propose a distributed decision making and spectrum sharing architecture (the D-Decision scheme) for each V2V link. Through extensive simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed C-Decision and D-Decision schemes can both achieve near-optimal performance and are robust to feedback interval variations, input noise, and feedback noise.},

Today's state-of-the-art SoCs contain an ever-growing number of IP cores, each of which is immersed in its independent clock domain. When the IP core population increases and the minimum transistor size shrinks, it is challenging to keep all the different clock domains synchronized across the die while maintaining the considerable data bandwidth between them. One of the most promising solutions to this interconnect issue is the Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous approach. Our goal is to provide an interconnection architecture which supports asynchronous communication between IPs working on its frequency. Instead of designing a fully asynchronous Network-on-Chip (NoC), our idea is to improve an existing synchronous NoC to support end-to-end asynchronous communication.},

This is because such applications require monitoring the network performances to control content quality, thus guarantee quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). In this paper, we propose a history-based TCP throughput prediction method incorporating communication quality features using SVR (Support Vector Regression). By taking history of communication quality features such as historical throughput and Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) into consideration, the throughput prediction error can be decreased. We conduct experiments with the proposed method and compare the prediction accuracy with a variety of methods in different scenarios of various moving modes of users. Results show that the proposed model could predict throughput effectively in various scenarios and decrease throughput prediction errors by a maximum of 26.47\% compared with other methods.},

  abstract = {Due to continuously growing communication traffic of emerging mobile phone applications, resource-efficient communication is a key to affordable network services with high Quality of Experience. While some communication traffic requires immediate resource allocations (such as voice services), an increasing number of mobile phone applications produce a lot of background communication traffic (e.g. social network apps, crowd sensing services). In this paper we discuss the predictive Channel-Aware Transmission (pCAT) scheme, which leverages the fact, that favorable channel conditions require much less spectrum resource allocation than bad channel conditions. By leveraging the knowledge of user trajectories and recurring spots with favorable channel conditions, the so-called LTE connectivity hot spots, background traffic transmissions can be scheduled by the client according to expected channel quality and application data priority. Thereby, the spectrum consumption of background traffic of applications can be reduced significantly. At the same time, the efficient usage of spectrum resources has also an impact on the battery lifetime of the mobile devices. By introducing the Context-Aware Power Consumption Model (CoPoMo) for LTE communications, we highlight, how decisions about the spectrum resource allocation by the network will impact the battery lifetime. One case study will show, that by simply changing the resource allocation scheme and without the need for spending more spectrum resources, the power consumption can be reduced by more than 70\% using the Energy-Efficient Scheduling (EES) introduced in this paper.},

In this paper, a novel OFDM channel prediction algorithm that uses a 2 times 1-dimensional frequency estimation to determine the time-delays and Doppler frequencies of each propagation path is investigated. The algorithm assumes a general far-field scatterer, frequency-selective wireless channel model and hence is applicable to a wide variety of wireless channel conditions.

The algorithm is based on an improved rank and subspace adaptive estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance techniques (ESPRIT). The adaptive ESPRIT is used to efficiently extract the slowly varying time-delays and Doppler frequencies of each ray, followed by a simple rotational update to compute the complex amplitudes. Our algorithm has a principal computational complexity that is linear in the number of pilot subcarriers used for prediction, in contrast to cubic complexity required for a non-adaptive block processing based algorithm.

To gain a deeper understanding of this important issue in the mobile environment, we conducted an eight-month measurement study consisting of 71 repeated trips along a 23Km route in Sydney under typical driving conditions. To account for the network diversity, we measure bandwidth from two independent cellular providers implementing the popular High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) technology in two different peak access rates (1.8 and 3.6Mbps). Interestingly, we observe no significant correlation between the bandwidth signals at different points in time within a given trip. This observation eventually leads to the revelation that the popular time series models, e.g. the Autoregressive and Moving Average, typically used to predict network traffic in static environments are not as effective in capturing the regularity in mobile bandwidth. Although the bandwidth signal in a given trip appears as a random white noise, we are able to detect the existence of patterns by analyzing the distribution of the bandwidth observed during the repeated trips. We quantify the bandwidth predictability reflected by these patterns using tools from information theory, entropy in particular. The entropy analysis reveals that the bandwidth uncertainty may reduce by as much as 46\% when observations from past trips are accounted for. We further demonstrate that the bandwidth in mobile computing appears more predictable when location is used as a context. All these observations are consistent across multiple independent providers offering different data transfer rates using possibly different networking hardware.},

We then develop a machine learning based prediction framework, LinkForecast, that identifies the most important features (from both upper and lower layers) and uses these features to predict link bandwidth in realtime. Our evaluation shows that LinkForecast is lightweight and the prediction is highly accurate: At the time granularity of one second, the average prediction error is in the range of 3.9 to 17.0 percent for all the scenarios we explore. We further investigate the prediction performance when using lower-layer features obtained through standard APIs provided by the operating system, instead of specialized tools. Our results show that, while the features thus obtained have lower fidelity compared to those from specialized tools, they lead to similar prediction accuracy, indicating that our approach can be easily used over commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices.},

  abstract = {Accurate cellular link bandwidth prediction can benefit upper-layer protocols significantly. In this paper, we investigate how to predict cellular link bandwidth in LTE networks. We first conduct an extensive measurement study in two major commercial LTE networks in the US, and identify five types of lower-layer information that are correlated with cellular link bandwidth. We then develop a machine learning based prediction framework, LinkForecast, that identifies the most important features (from both upper and lower layers) and uses these features to predict link bandwidth in realtime. Our evaluation shows that LinkForecast is lightweight and the prediction is highly accurate: At the time granularity of one second, the average prediction error is in the range of 3.9 to 17.0 percent for all the scenarios we explore. We further investigate the prediction performance when using lower-layer features obtained through standard APIs provided by the operating system, instead of specialized tools. Our results show that, while the features thus obtained have lower fidelity compared to those from specialized tools, they lead to similar prediction accuracy, indicating that our approach can be easily used over commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices.},

  abstract = {The standard 802.11p/wave provides communication facilities to many vehicle applications. The safety application for vehicle collision avoidance is one of the most attractive issues for industrial and research concerns. However, medium access protocols proposed by standards and research works are not dedicated to this kind of real time applications. A deterministic medium access is needed to guarantee communication delay constraints. Thus, we propose an extension of the CSMA/CA medium access defined in the standard. It is an enhancement of the collision resolution procedure to be deterministic. An infrastructure with Road Side Units (RSUs) is used to manage the secured zone. It is also to complete and control communication for collision detection approach. This new protocol has the main advantage of low bandwidth utilization, low latency and deterministic communication. We have also proposed a worst case analysis model to predict communication delay in order to verify the real time constraints. Simulations are made to perform the efficiency of our protocol relative to other ones.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop and analyze the basic methodology for minimum-energy (ME) band-limited prediction of sampled time-variant flat-fading channels. This predictor is based on a subspace spanned by time-concentrated and band-limited sequences. The time-concentration of these sequences is matched to the length of the observation interval and the band-limitation is determined by the support of the Doppler power spectral density of the fading process. Slepian showed that discrete prolate spheroidal (DPS) sequences can be used to calculate the ME band-limited continuation of a finite sequence. We utilize this property to perform channel prediction. We generalize the concept of time-concentrated and band-limited sequences to a band-limiting region consisting of disjoint intervals. For a fading process with constant spectrum over its possibly discontiguous support we prove that the ME band-limited predictor is identical to a reduced-rank maximum-likelihood predictor which is a close approximation of a Wiener predictor. In current cellular communication systems the time-selective fading process is highly oversampled. The essential dimension of the subspace spanned by time-concentrated and band-limited sequences is in the order of two to five only. The prediction error mainly depends on the support of the Doppler spectrum. We exploit this fact to propose low-complexity time-variant flat-fading channel predictors using dynamically selected predefined subspaces. The subspace selection is based on a probabilistic bound on the reconstruction error. We compare the performance of the ME band-limited predictor with a predictor based on complex exponentials. For a prediction horizon of one eights of a wavelength the numerical simulation results show that the ME band-limited predictor with dynamic subspace selection performs better than, or similar to, a predictor based on complex exponentials with perfectly known frequencies. For a prediction horizons of three eights of a wavelength the performance of the ME band-limited predictor approaches that of a Wiener predictor with perfectly known Doppler bandwidth.},

To reduce the communication overhead and thus enhance the system throughput, we propose a channel prediction based scheduling strategy for data dissemination in VANETs. The channel prediction is built upon the recursive least squares algorithm. With low computational complexity, our proposed strategy achieves high scheduling efficiency verified by simulations of transmission delay and system throughput under both urban and highway scenarios.},

  abstract = {Most conventional heterogeneous network selection strategies applied in heterogeneous vehicular network regard the performance of each network constant in various traffic scenarios. This assumption leads such strategies to be ineffective in the real-world performance-changing scenarios. To solve this problem, we propose an optimal game approach for heterogeneous vehicular network selection under conditions in which the performance parameters of some networks are changing. Terminals attempting to switch to the network with higher evaluation is formulated as a multi-play non-cooperative game. Heterogeneous vehicular network characteristics are thoroughly accounted for to adjust the game strategy and adapt to the vehicular environment for stability and rapid convergence. A multi-play non-cooperative game model is built to formulate network selection. A probabilistic strategy is used to gradually drive players toward convergence to prevent instability. Furthermore, a system prototype was built at the Connected and Automated Vehicle Test bed of Chang'an University (CAVTest). Its corresponding test results indicate that the proposed approach can effectively suppress the ping-pong effect caused by massive handoffs due to varying network performance and thus well outperforms the single-play strategy.},

First framework makes use of machine learning approach, and the second one is realized with model-based estimation. Both frameworks are developed based on the measurement data which was gathered over the 5,5 month of the field trials in the simTD project. In our paper we also suggest an optimization method to increase prediction accuracy and validate both frameworks through an additional real-world measurement campaign. The main advantages of suggested algorithms comparing to the existing work is their completely generic nature and low to no memory requirements. We demonstrate that in low network density scenarios prediction accuracy can reach up to 97\%.},
